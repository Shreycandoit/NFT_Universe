# Project Name : NFT Universe

## Description 

An NFT database that includes entities for different blockchains such as Ethereum, Solana, BNB, Algorand, and so on, NFT projects on these blockchains, NFT segments such as art, collectible, game, metaverse, and utility.

We will be comparing different projects and determining which ones tend to do better over time, while also studying the market trends.

This project would serve as a one-stop shop for a range of users regardless of their experience in the NFT space and provide more value in less time.
